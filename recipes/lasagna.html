        <p>Lasagne may seem daunting to make from scratch but it's not difficult! Here's a breakdown of the elements;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ragu or meat sauce - </strong>the beef ragu takes around 10-15 minutes to prep (cutting the veg, browning the meat etc) but once you've done that you leave it to simmer away for a few hours while you get on with your day, easy!</li>
            <li><strong>Pasta -</strong> if you're making homemade pasta then the prep time is increased significantly which is fine if you're having a fun day of cooking but if you want as less prep as possible then use pre-bought fresh lasagna sheets/noodles. You can use dried but I recommend using fresh, see my notes below on why.</li>
            <li><strong>Bechamel sauce -</strong> this lasagna is a traditional Italian version so it's made with bechamel sauce and NOT ricotta cheese. You'll see ricotta used in Italian-American recipes. Don't worry though making a bechamel sauce from scratch takes no more than 10 mins and it can be prepped in advance or just before you are ready to assemble the dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Assembling the dish -</strong> this is the fun part and takes around 10 minutes (if that). Just layer up the pasta, ragu, bechamel and top with cheese, simple!</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking the lasagne -</strong> it takes around 45 minutes to bake in the oven so you can see why from start to finish it takes a pretty long time but all that time is not spent in the kitchen. Once you've made this from scratch using all our tips you won't believe how simple it is!</li>
        </ul>

            <li><h4><em>Il Soffrito</em></h4>
                <p>The ragu starts like a lot of Italian sauces, stews and soups, with Il Soffritto.</p>
                <p>Soffritto is very simply, finely chopped carrot, celery and white onion sauteed slowly with a little olive oil for about 10 minutes until soft.</p>
                <p>This adds incredible depth of flavour to many dishes and can even be made in advance to add into weeknight meals for an extra flavour punch.</p>
                <p><strong>Top Tip:</strong> Make a big batch and freeze it, you can cook it straight from frozen!</p>
            </li>

                <h4><em>How to make the Ragu:</em></h4>
                <p>Finely chop the carrot, celery and onion and sweat slowly with a little olive oil in a large, deep skillet or pan.</p>
                <p>Once you've sauteed the veggies, add the meat and brown whilst breaking it up with a wooden spoon.</p>
                <p>Add the red wine and reduce by half. Once the wine has reduced, add the sieved tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaf, 4 cups of the beef stock and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir everything together and leave to simmer on a low heat for 2.5-3 hours uncovered. Add the rest of the beef stock half way through.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><em>How to make Bechamel Sauce</em></h4>
                <p>Add the butter to a saucepan and cook until melted and bubbling.</p>
                <p>Add the flour to the melted butter and stir to form a paste. Let the flour cook for 1 minute.</p>
                <p>Slowly whisk half of the milk into the butter and flour constantly whisking to avoid any lumps. Once it has started to thicken add the rest of the milk, nutmeg, parmesan and a pinch of salt and pepper.</p>
                <p>Continue to heat the sauce whilst stirring until thickened enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Take off the heat and set aside</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><em>How to assemble the Lasagne</em></h4>
                <p>To assemble the lasagne, spoon a small amount of ragu on the very bottom of the baking dish. Top with and even layer of lasagna pasta sheets.</p>
                <p>Add a few more spoons of ragu so the pasta is completely covered followed by white sauce.</p>
                <p>Repeat the layers of pasta, ragu and bechamel sauce finishing with a layer of pasta topped with bechamel sauce (you should have 4-5 layers of pasta). Cover the top layer of the lasagne with torn mozzarella and then bake in the oven until bubbling and golden.</p>

                <h4><em>Dried vs Fresh Lasagne Sheets</em></h4>
                <p>When making lasagne <strong> I always use fresh lasagna sheets</strong> or make my own homemade pasta if I have time.</p>
                <p>Fresh lasagna sheets have a much nicer texture than dried and it <strong>saves time having to pre-boil them.</strong></p>
                <p>I also find that dried lasagna sheets curl up as they cook so you don't get a nice defined layer.</p>
